## Proj3_SongWriter

## Instructions:
The user (Artist/Singer/Songstress) will use the Song App Data program to create a new song.  The Artist can create a database by inputing the song name, genre, youtube links, song type (ie. love, trap, jazz) and various other artist. With the use of API technology all songs associated to the inputs will be pulled up.

## Objectives Met:
The objectives of this project are to:

- 2 Models
- 7 Restful Routes
- Mongo Query
- WireFrame_Met
- User Story_Met
- ERD
- Clean CSS/HTML
- Deployed Online

## Technologies used:
- cookie-parser
- debug
- dotenv
- express
- hbs
- http-errors
- method-override
- mongoose
- morgan
- nodemon

## The approach was taken:
Started by creating ERD, Wireframes, Trello.  Then I created my checklist, models and schemas. Lastly, I created my seeds,then created views, and worked on routes. My front styling came absolutely last. With more time and consultation with the UX students, this app could really prove to be useful. See link below.

## Version2:
In version2 of SongWriter....ERD PDF

## Problems:
The biggest problem on this project was understanding the material (ei. Mongo, REACT, AJAX). Initially, I did not understand the material completely, and I had some personal/health struggles along with communication challenges.  By the time I got everything set up and related properly, I was emotionally exhausted.  I believe with more time, I can develope full CRUD and API technology.
